# MSDS_454_Advanced_Modeling_Techniques 

This course acts as a ‘modeling capstone’ through the application of the topics covered in the core modeling sequence and their 
extension to the more advanced topics from modern statistical and machine learning. The high level objectives of this course are to 
teach students how to build statistical models on larger data sets, and how to build statistical models on a modeling team. 
To meet these objectives each student will complete a series of individual assignments on the standard predictive modeling problems of 
regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification; and a larger unstructured team project on a large data set. 
High level topics typically included in this course are: exploratory data analysis with advanced statistical graphics, classification and 
regression trees, Random Forest, model complexity and regularization techniques such as the LASSO, boosting, model ensembles, neural networks, 
and genetic algorithms.
